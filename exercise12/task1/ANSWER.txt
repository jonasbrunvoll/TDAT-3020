# PROBLEM
# The vulnerable point of the system is that the whole barcode 
# is sent as an argument into the SQL sentence.
# This is dangeruse because with the right barcode you could send 
# actual commands which can edit the database table. NOT GOOD!

# FIXED
# Fixed the problem by ensuring that the data=b has to be an integer 
# and only the data=b is sendt as an argument in the SQL-sentence.
